# Desktop application

Start with `radixscope-gui` or `python -m radixscope.gui`. Use Ctrl+1 through Ctrl+4
to switch workspaces. Enter in the main input field runs the calculation. Results can be
selected or copied with **Copy result**. Invalid input clears the previous result
and displays the error above the output.

## Conversion

Choose Number for digits in a selected source base, or Expression for exact mixed-base
arithmetic. List target bases separated by commas. Exact output uses parentheses around
recurring digits; long expansions end with an ellipsis and list the bases that reached
the 1000-digit display limit. The rational value remains exact.

Turn off exact output to choose fractional digits and a rounding mode. This produces
a fixed-precision result in each target base.

## Trace

The output lists integer division and fractional multiplication steps, the resulting
digits and the start of a repeating cycle. Set the maximum fractional steps to bound
the display. `complete: False` means the limit was reached before the expansion ended
or its cycle was established; it does not mean the number terminates.

## Programmer

Select a base, bit width, signedness and whether the input is a mathematical integer
or a raw bit pattern. The GUI supports widths 1 through 4096; the Python model accepts
any positive width. Pattern input is unsigned digits before interpretation, so `FF`
at eight signed bits means -1. Mathematical input must fit the selected range.

Operations include add, subtract, multiply, AND, OR, XOR, NOT and shifts. Shift operands
are decimal counts. `shr` is arithmetic for signed values, while `lshr` always fills
with zero. Arithmetic results show both the exact result and overflow flag alongside
the explicitly wrapped value. The byte preview preserves width and selected endian order.

## IEEE 754

Encode accepts exact expressions, NaN and infinity. Decode interprets raw digits in
the selected pattern base. Choose binary32 or binary64. Results include the exact
rational value when finite, classification, separated bit fields, hex and endian bytes.

Signed-zero controls apply to encoding zero. NaN controls become available for `nan`
or `-nan`; unchecking Quiet NaN requires a nonzero payload. Disabled encoding controls
are ignored during raw decoding. Changing modes keeps the input text for editing.

## Preferences and recent history

Settings → Preferences selects System, Light or Dark theme and enables or disables
recent history with a limit of 1 through 100 entries. The default limit is 20.
Current input and workspace options, active tab and window size are restored on startup.

The Recent panel stores input, options, timestamp and a short result summary, excluding
full trace output. Identical inputs and options move to the front instead of duplicating.
Double-click an entry or use Restore selected input; Run computes the restored input.
Clear history removes saved recent entries. Turning history off stops new entries;
current workspace options and input are still saved independently.

Preferences are saved on successful calculations, explicit preference changes and window
close. Writes replace the settings file atomically. Unreadable or malformed settings use
defaults and display a status message. A write failure keeps the previous file and does
not prevent calculations. The CLI does not read or modify desktop preferences.
