# Installation

## From a checkout

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Koreapanda4444/radixscope.git
cd radixscope
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment with `.venv\Scripts\activate` in Windows Command Prompt,
or `source .venv/bin/activate` on Linux. Then:

```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install ".[gui]"
python -m radixscope.gui
```

Use `python -m pip install .` for the dependency-free core and command line only.
Installing the `gui` extra adds PySide6 and Qt. The desktop entry point explains the
missing extra when PySide6 is absent.

## From a release package

Open a successful Quality run in GitHub Actions, download its package artifact and extract
the ZIP. Then run from the directory containing the wheel:

```sh
python -m pip install "radixscope-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl[gui]"
radixscope-gui
```

Omit `[gui]` when only the command line is needed. These are Python distributions;
they require Python and do not bundle a standalone Windows executable.

## Linux desktop libraries

Qt needs the system graphics libraries even when imported by a headless test.
On Ubuntu/Debian, install the libraries used by CI:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libegl1 libopengl0
```

For a desktop session using Qt's XCB platform, the distribution may also need
`libxcb-cursor0` and its normal X11 runtime libraries. Use `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`
for tests without a display; that setting does not open a desktop window.

## Updating an existing checkout

```sh
git pull --ff-only origin main
python -m pip install --upgrade ".[gui]"
python -m radixscope.gui
```

The 2.0.0 rewrite replaces the old Base-Converter modules. It does not import old
configuration or history files. New preferences and recent inputs live in Qt's
per-user application data directory under `Koreapanda4444/RadixScope/state.json`.
